# GiftingApp
An application where users are able to manage gifting lists for a household.

## App Overview

Users are able to create a household and invite other users to their household. A household is a group of christmas or gifting lists that each user manages themselves. Users of the houshold can assign themselves as the "gifter" to an item in one of those gifting lists. A household also has the option to randomly assign people to lists for gifting. A gifting list contains text describing what the item is, a priority or rank for how much the item is wanted, and an associated link.
